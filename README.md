# CISC 340 - Computer Architecture
This repository contains the MIPS code that I wrote for computer architecture, which I took during the fall of 2023. MIPS is an assembly language, which is intended to communicate directly with a computer's hardware. In this class, we began learning how to write MIPS code. I found how unique MIPS is in comparison to higher-level programming languages such as Python or Java. Memory allocation is incredibly important, and how you decide to use the registers in MIPS can make or break your code. Writing assembly language for the first time forces you to think outside of all higher-level languages that you have worked in, as you can encounter problems much easier by not following coding and/or stack conventions. These labs involved using a plethora of MIPS instructions to accomplish tasks in assembly that we had previously written in other languages such as Python or Java. Branching, recursion, floating points, and more were all apart of the labs that we worked on in this class, learning about how MIPS functions and works with hardware. In order to run any of these programs that I have added to the repository, install MARS onto your machine and copy and paste my code into a new file in MARS. Then, run the program.
